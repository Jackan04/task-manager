# Task Manager — Personal Task Manager

A delightful and minimal personal task manager built with React and Firebase.
Task Manager lets you create lists, add tasks, set due dates, and jot down notes, helping you stay organized without the clutter. It’s fast, simple, and designed to feel like a digital extension of your notebook.

## Core Features

- Create, edit, and delete **tasks**
- Create, edit, and delete **lists**
- View task details by clicking on the _ellipsis_ icon (hover on desktop, always visible on mobile)
- Quick-add tasks from the header or open the detailed add modal (title, notes, due date, list)
- Mark tasks as complete
- View stats for each list (all / remaining / completed)
- Filter tasks by list or show all tasks
- Tasks are automatically sorted by due date, with completed tasks moved to the bottom.
- Toggle **light/dark theme**, saved in local storage

## Tech Stack

- React (Vite)
- Firebase Firestore

## Run Locally

Firebase setup (local)

1. Create a Firebase project at https://console.firebase.google.com/ and enable Firestore.
2. Create a Web app in your Firebase project and copy the config values.
3. In the project root create a `.env.local` file (this file is ignored by git).
4. Add the keys (sample names provided in `.env.example`):

**Run**

1. Install dependencies

`npm install`

2. Start the dev server

`npm run dev`

Then open `http://localhost:5173` (or whatever Vite shows in your terminal).
